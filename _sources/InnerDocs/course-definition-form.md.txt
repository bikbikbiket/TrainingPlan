# Course Definition Forms


Based on the [Course Structure](course-structure.md) every Course will have a *Unique ID* based on **Identification**, **Content**, and **Implementation** details. Those three classes, contained within the Course class, represents different aspects of the course. Please use “[Course Definition Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peXF74GnOtcX3-bXIWZ_ZwPPtuPwqTCGFnuPVxGJNdc/edit?usp=sharing)” template to form the courses you suggest. 

For details and the explanations of each attribute please follow the [Course Structure](course-structure.md)
