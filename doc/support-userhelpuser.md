# User Helping User

Below some ideas to consider for implementing a "user helping user" context:

## Roadmap

1. **Building a Knowledge Base (Directly related w/ WP3):**
   - Develop a comprehensive knowledge base with FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. 
   
   ```{admonition} Important
   - Organize information in a user-friendly manner with clear categories and search functionality.  
   ```
2. **Periodic User Surveys:**
   - Conduct user surveys or interviews to understand common challenges users face.
   - Identify the areas where users need assistance or clarification.

   ```{admonition} Important
   - Design different type of surveys to gather quantitative data on user preferences and qualitative insights into specific challenges.
   ```

3. **Community Platform:**
   - Implement a messaging board or forum where users can interact with each other.
   - Categorize discussions to make it easy for users to find relevant topics.  

   ```{admonition} Important
   
   1. **Requirement Analysis:**
      - User authentication, post creation, commenting, voting, user profiles, moderation tools, etc. Details must be decided in this step.

   2. **Tech Stack:** 
      - **Frontend:** UI for the messaging board.
      - **Backend:** Server-side logic to handle user requests, manage data, and enforce business rules
      - **Database:** DB schema to store user data, posts, comments, and other relevant information.

   3. **User Authentication:**
      - Implement user authentication and authorization. Feide?

   4. **Search Functionality:**
      - Implement a search feature to allow users to find relevant posts and discussions easily.

   5. **Community Guidelines & Moderation and Deployment:**
      - Establish clear community guidelines and implement moderation tools to manage user-generated content effectively & deploy the app on NAIC.

   ```

4. **Guided User Meetings and Live Q&A Sessions (maybe later):**
   - Host regular webinars or online meetings to guide users through specific topics.
   - Allow users to ask questions during these sessions.
   - Record sessions for future reference and on-demand viewing.

   ```{admonition} Important
   - **Diverse Topics:** Diverse range of topics (new features, advanced usage, and troubleshooting common issues)
   - **Interactive Q&A:** Interactive Q&A sessions within the webinars to address user queries in real-time. Encourage users to submit questions in advance.
   - **Diversified Panel:** Diverse panel of experts (including developers, support staff, and experienced users) to participate in live Q&A sessions.
   ```

5. **User-Generated Content (maybe later):**
   - Encourage users to contribute content, such as tutorials, tips, and case studies.
   ```{admonition} Important
   - Develop *"interactive tutorials"* that guide users through complex tasks step by step.
   - Share *"real-world case studies"* showcasing how other users have successfully implemented on NAIC.
   ```
  

6. **Weekly Challenges (maybe later):**
   - Introduce weekly challenges or tasks to keep users engaged.
   - Challenges can be related to exploring new features or solving specific problems.
