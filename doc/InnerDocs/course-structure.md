# Basic Hierarchy


This will be our basic structure. The Course class is the main class that encapsulates the entire course structure. Identification, Content, and Implementation are three classes contained within the Course class, representing different aspects of the course.  Attributes within each class represent the data or properties. Details and the explanations of each attribute can be found in the presentation.
