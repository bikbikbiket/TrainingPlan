# Course Definition Forms

Those three classes, contained within the Course class, represents different aspects of the course. Please use “[Course Definition Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqzBe7BiyVNYkPYuzn4a-pHFm3BBtQ7NrGj2T1ggMLA/edit?usp=sharing)” template to form the courses you suggest.
