# NAIC Training Plan

This tutorial shows all the **events**[^note] related with the NAIC Training processes. Initial plan is to create a Training Plan in two different ways: **Asynchronous Courses** and **Synchronous Courses**.


## Asynchronous Courses

Those courses will be **asynchronous**. 

### **1. CodeRefinery Courses** 

These are the lessons which are included in the "standard" CodeRefinery workshop, and what we believe that every computational scientist (even those with very small amounts of computation) should know. But there is more: Also see all of our online lessons.

   -    #### [Introduction to version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
        This lesson brings you from zero to using Git and GitHub for own projects.
   -    #### [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)
        This lesson builds on "Introduction to version control" and we apply branching and learn about pull requests (merge requests), forks, and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
   -    #### [Reproducible research](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/)
        We focus here on 3 aspects of reproducible programs and computations: documenting dependencies, environments, and computational steps in a reproducible way. We touch on containers.

   -    #### [Social coding and open software](https://coderefinery.github.io/social-coding/)
        We motivate and give an overview over software and data licensing and software citation best practices.
   
   -    #### [Documentation](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/)
        Here we give an overview of the different ways how a code project can be documented: from small projects to larger projects. Markdown and Sphinx are central tools in this lesson.
   
  -    #### [Jupyter notebooks](https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/)
       This lesson gives an overview of what Jupyter notebooks are, when they can be particularly useful, and shows best practices for reusable and reproducible notebooks.
   
  -    #### [Automated testing](https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/)
       In this lesson we talk about motivation for testing, about test design, but also about some tools that are typically used for automated testing of software.
   
 -    #### [Modular code development type-along](https://coderefinery.github.io/modular-type-along/)
      The focus of this lesson is how to partition and organize projects as they grow from one screen-full to larger and how to make code portions reusable across projects and across notebooks.

```{admonition} Examples
- The course name, content, duration, and video materials will be available.
- These courses can provide links to NRIS's HPC courses or CodeRefinery training [video](https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/) recordings text files.
   


For Git Intro, such a CR playlist can be used:

```

### **2. NRIS Courses** 

## Synchronous Courses

Synchronous courses under this heading can be conducted in two ways:

```{admonition} Examples

```

### **1. Online Courses** 
- Periodic courses created according to a timeline.

```{admonition} Examples
We can include a few planned CR schedules here.
```

### **2. Physical Courses**
- For these courses, it is necessary to directly contact the personnel who will provide face-to-face instruction and discuss the frequency of their classes.

```{admonition} Examples
We don't have any examples for this yet, but there will be individuals who prefer this option, especially those who want to receive one-on-one and active instruction in environments like a LAB and ask questions to the instructor immediately.
```

[^note]:
    These are **Past** and **Upcoming** Events.
