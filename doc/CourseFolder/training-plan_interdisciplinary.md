## Data Wrangling

### Data Understanding and Knowledge Discovery Process
Basic concepts, definitions, data types and formats.

What should we teach:
- Introduction to Programming: R programming, Python.
- Introduction to Version Control Systems: Github 
- Introduction to Productivity Tools: Installing R, R-Studio, Git.
- The data, problems, and tools that data analysts use
- Common data storage systems


### Data Collection (Data Gathering)
Gather data from various sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, text files, web scraping, or APIs. 


### Data Inspection and Cleaning
Examine the raw data to understand its structure, size, and quality. Check for missing values, duplicates, outliers, and any anomalies that may affect the analysis.  Address data quality issues by:

- Handling missing values: Decide whether to remove, impute, or use default values for missing data.
- Removing duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records if they exist.
- Correcting errors: Fix data entry errors, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Standardizing data: Ensure consistency in data formats (e.g., date formats, units of measurement).
- Handling outliers: Decide how to deal with outliers based on domain knowledge and analysis goals.

### Data Transformation
Transform the data to make it suitable for analysis:
- Data encoding: Convert categorical data into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Scaling and normalization: Standardize numerical variables to have similar scales.
- Feature engineering: Create new features or variables that provide more information for analysis.
- Aggregation: Summarize data at different levels (e.g., group by category, time period).
- Pivot and reshape data: Rearrange data to facilitate analysis (e.g., pivot tables).
- Date and time manipulation: Extract relevant information from date and time columns.
- Data Reduction: Reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting relevant variables or features for analysis. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be employed.


### Data Analysis 

Aim: Make sense of your data to extract meaningful insights. 

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (How to explore data relationships)
  - Descriptive Analysis (What happened)
  - Diagnostic Analysis  (Why it happened)
  - Predictive Analysis (What will happen)
  - Prescriptive Analysis (How will it happen)
