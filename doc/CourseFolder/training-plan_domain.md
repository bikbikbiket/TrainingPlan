```{admonition} Introduction to machine learning applications in genomic analysis

Abstract: Our short course, "Introduction to Machine Learning Applications in Genomic Analysis," is specifically designed to provide an overview of the key machine learning concepts and their use cases in genomic analysis. The course begins with an introduction to the main concepts of machine learning technologies, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, providing participants with a basic understanding of how these technologies work. Next, the course will introduce various genomic analysis methods that can potentially benefit from machine learning technologies. Here, we will introduce participants to recently developed machine-learning-based genomic analysis tools, while highlighting their underlying technologies. Importantly, we will highlight the challenges of using these tools in genomic analysis and discuss the associated risks. By the end of the course, participants will have gained a basic understanding of machine learning use cases in genomic analysis, as well as the current challenges and risks of this growing field.
