```{objectives}
- Questions
  - Why would I be interested in High Performance Computing (HPC) ?
  - What can I expect to learn from this course?    

- Objectives
  - Be able to describe what an HPC system is
  - Identify how an HPC system could benefit you.  
  
- Keypoints
  - High Performance Computing (HPC) typically involves connecting to very large computing systems elsewhere in the world.
  - These other systems can be used to do work that would either be impossible or much slower on  smaller systems.
  - The standard method of interacting with such systems is via a command line interface called Bash.
