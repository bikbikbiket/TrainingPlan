```{objectives}
- Questions
  - Why would I be interested in High Performance Computing (HPC) ?
  - What can I expect to learn from this course?    

- Objectives
  - Be able to describe what an HPC system is
  - Identify how an HPC system could benefit you.  
  
- Keypoints
  - High Performance Computing (HPC) typically involves connecting to very large computing systems elsewhere in the world.
  - These other systems can be used to do work that would either be impossible or much slower on  smaller systems.
  - The standard method of interacting with such systems is via a command line interface called Bash.

````{discussion}
Frequently, research problems that use computing can outgrow the capabilities of the desktop
or laptop computer where they started: 

**Use the shared document to write down if you have experienced this or you know a senario 
where the laptop or the desktop was not enough**

(Pause for 5min for learners to respond)

 ```{solution}
 * A statistics student wants to cross-validate a model. This involves running the model 1000
  times -- but each run takes an hour. Running the model on a laptop will take over a month!

 * A genomics researcher has been using small datasets of sequence data, but soon will be receiving
  a new type of sequencing data that is 10 times as large. It's already challenging to open the
  datasets on a computer -- analyzing these larger datasets will probably crash it.

 * An engineer is using a fluid dynamics package that has an option to run in parallel. So far, 
   this option was not utilized on a desktop. In going from 2D to 3D simulations, the simulation
   time has more than tripled. It might be useful to take advantage of that option or feature.

  In all these cases, access to more computers is needed. Those computers should be usable at the same time.

- **Understand** how static site generators build websites out of plain
  text files.
- Create example Sphinx documentation and learn some Markdown along the way.
